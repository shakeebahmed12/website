                    Because of how busy the modern lifestyle happens to be in the developed world, many families find themselves taking a trip to their favorite fast food restaurant more often than they would care to admit. According to information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 45% of a familyâ€™s food budget goes toward eating out somewhere. In 1977, that rate was at just 38%. That means the average household is spending upwards of $6,000 per year just to eat outside of the home.
